```bash
docker compose exec backend python manage.py makemigrations authentication --name add_user_table
```

### Apply Migrations

```bash
docker compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
```

---

## 🔄 n8n Configuration

To access n8n locally you may need to add an entry to your `/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1 n8n.localhost
```

The `n8n/` directory contains reference workflows and data-pipeline scripts that new developers can use to bootstrap a local n8n instance.

### Workflows

All workflow JSON files live in `n8n/workflows/`. Import them via **n8n UI → Settings → Import workflow** or through the n8n REST API.

> **Credential placeholder:** MySQL/Postgres credential IDs inside the JSONs are placeholders (`WAREHOUSE_DB_CREDENTIAL_ID`, `Postgres account`, etc.). After importing, open each workflow and reassign the credentials to the ones you created in your local n8n instance.

#### 🤖 Agent Workflows

##### `agent-data-analyst.json` — Agent — Data Analyst (Nora)

A RAG-enabled conversational agent that exposes a public chat webhook.

| Component | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Trigger** | Public chat webhook (allows any origin) |
| **LLM** | OpenRouter Chat Model (configurable model, custom system prompt) |
| **Memory** | PostgreSQL Chat Memory — retains last 10 messages, keyed by session ID |
| **Knowledge base** | PGVector Store — semantic search over indexed documents |
| **Embeddings** | OpenAI Embeddings |

**Required n8n credentials:** OpenRouter API key, OpenAI API key, Postgres connection.

---

#### 📚 Knowledge Base (KB) Workflows

These eight webhook-driven workflows form a complete CRUD API for managing knowledge bases and their indexed documents. They are called by the Enlaight backend and power the RAG pipeline.

| File | Workflow name | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `create-kb.json` | **Create — KB** | `POST` | Creates a new knowledge base record in Postgres. Validates the payload, generates a unique hash ID, and guards against duplicate names. |
| `get-kb.json` | **Get — KB** | `GET` | Fetches a single knowledge base by ID from Postgres. |
| `get-all-kb.json` | **Get All — KB** | `GET` | Returns the full list of knowledge bases available to the requesting API key. |
| `edit-kb.json` | **Edit — KB** | `PATCH` | Updates the name or metadata of an existing knowledge base. |
| `delete-kb.json` | **Delete — KB** | `DELETE` | Deletes a knowledge base and all its associated vector embeddings from PGVector and Postgres. |
| `add-file-kb.json` | **Add File — KB** | `POST` | Uploads a document to a knowledge base. Reads the file from disk, splits it with a Recursive Character Text Splitter, embeds it with OpenAI, and stores the vectors in PGVector. Guards against re-indexing the same file. |
| `list-files-kb.json` | **List Files — KB** | `GET` | Lists all documents indexed in a given knowledge base. |
| `delete-files-kb.json` | **Delete Files — KB** | `DELETE` | Removes a specific document's vectors from PGVector and its metadata from Postgres. |

**Required n8n credentials:** Postgres connection (PGVector), OpenAI API key.

#### 🔌 YouScan Data Pipeline Workflows

Two scheduled workflows that implement the same logic as the Python scripts in `n8n/scripts/` (see [Scripts](#scripts) below), running natively inside n8n. They run back-to-back each night.

##### `youscan-collect-mentions.json` — YouScan — Collect Mentions

**Schedule:** daily at 01:00 UTC

**What it does:**

1. **Build Date Range** — computes `startDate` / `endDate` for the previous calendar day (UTC).
2. **Get Active Topics from DB** — queries `youscan_topics` in the warehouse MySQL DB.
3. **Fetch Topics (API Key 1/2/3)** — parallel HTTP calls to the YouScan `/topics/` endpoint for each configured key.
4. **Merge & Filter Topics** — builds a `topicId → {name, query, api_key}` map, filtered to only topics active in the DB.
5. **Collect Mentions (Paginated)** — cursor-based pagination via `sinceSeq`, with exponential back-off retry for 429 / 5xx (max 5 attempts), runs per topic in parallel.
6. **Write JSON to Disk** — writes one `youscan_mentions_{topic_id}_{date}_{uuid}.json` file per topic to `RAW_DATA_DIR`.

| Nodes used | Types |
|---|---|
| Schedule Trigger, Code (×4), HTTP Request (×3), MySQL | n8n built-in |

---

##### `youscan-normalize-mentions.json` — YouScan — Normalize Mentions

**Schedule:** daily at 02:00 UTC

**What it does:**

1. **Scan Raw Directory** — lists all `*.json` files in `RAW_DATA_DIR`; short-circuits gracefully if empty.
2. **Read JSON File** — parses each raw file (one n8n item per file).
3. **Topic dedup** — checks `youscan_topics`; inserts if new, resolves the internal DB `id`.
4. **File dedup** — checks `youscan_ingestion_files` by UUID; skips the entire file if already processed.
5. **Insert Ingestion File Record** — records the file metadata.
6. **Explode Mentions** — fans out one n8n item per mention.
7. **Mention dedup** — checks `youscan_mentions` by `youscan_mention_id`; skips duplicates.
8. **Build Mention Row** — normalizes all fields: timestamps via JS `Date`, source string cleaned, JSON arrays serialized.
9. **Insert Mention** — writes to `youscan_mentions`.
10. **Explode Content Shards → Insert Content Shard** — inserts `title`, `text`, `fullText` as separate rows in `youscan_content`.
11. **Move File to Ingested** — `fs.renameSync` moves the processed file to `INGESTED_DATA_DIR`.

| Nodes used | Types |
|---|---|
| Schedule Trigger, Code (×9), Filter (×4), MySQL (×8) | n8n built-in |

**Required n8n credentials for both YouScan workflows:**

| Credential type | Used by |
|---|---|
| MySQL (`Warehouse MySQL`) | Both workflows — reads active topics, writes normalized data |

**Required environment variables (set in `.env`):**

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `YOUSCAN_API_KEYS` | Comma-separated list of YouScan API keys (one per account) |
| `YOUSCAN_URL` | YouScan external API base URL (e.g. `https://api.youscan.io/api/external/`) |
| `WAREHOUSE_DATABASE_URL` | SQLAlchemy / MySQL connection URL for the warehouse DB |
| `RAW_DATA_DIR` | Local path where the collector writes raw JSON files (default: `./data/raw`) |
| `INGESTED_DATA_DIR` | Local path where the normalizer moves processed files (default: `./data/ingested`) |

---

### Scripts

The `n8n/scripts/` directory contains standalone Python scripts that implement the same YouScan data pipeline logic as the n8n workflows above. They are kept as a reference and can be run independently (e.g. via cron or for local development/debugging) without needing a running n8n instance.

> All credentials are read exclusively from environment variables — no hardcoded secrets.

#### `youscan_collect_mentions.py`

Collects social media mentions from the YouScan API for all active topics and saves them as raw JSON files to the local filesystem.

**What it does:**

1. Reads active topic IDs from the warehouse MySQL DB (`youscan_topics` table).
2. Fetches all topics from the YouScan API across all configured API keys, building a `topic_id → {name, query, api_key}` map.
3. For each active topic, paginates the YouScan mentions endpoint using cursor-based pagination (`sinceSeq`) to collect all mentions from the previous calendar day.
4. Retries transient errors (HTTP 429 / 5xx) with exponential back-off (up to 5 attempts).
5. Writes one JSON file per topic to `RAW_DATA_DIR`, named `youscan_mentions_{topic_id}_{date}_{uuid}.json`.

**Required environment variables:**

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `YOUSCAN_API_KEYS` | Comma-separated YouScan API keys |
| `YOUSCAN_URL` | YouScan API base URL |
| `WAREHOUSE_DATABASE_URL` | MySQL connection URL for the warehouse DB |
| `RAW_DATA_DIR` | Output directory for raw JSON files (default: `./data/raw`) |

**Run:**

```bash
pip install requests mysql-connector-python
python n8n/scripts/youscan_collect_mentions.py
```

---

#### `youscan_normalize_mentions.py`

Reads raw JSON files produced by the collector, normalizes and deduplicates them into the warehouse MySQL database, then moves each processed file to an archive directory.

**What it does:**

1. Scans `RAW_DATA_DIR` for `*.json` files (sorted, processed in order).
2. For each file, runs a 3-level deduplication pipeline:
   - **Topic** — upserts into `youscan_topics` if the topic ID is new.
   - **File** — skips the file entirely if its UUID is already recorded in `youscan_ingestion_files`.
   - **Mention** — skips individual mentions whose `youscan_mention_id` already exists in `youscan_mentions`.
3. Normalizes all fields: timestamps parsed via `dateutil` (timezone-aware), source strings stripped of stray quotes, JSON arrays serialized for storage.
4. Inserts content shards (`title`, `text`, `fullText`) as separate rows in `youscan_content` for independent queryability.
5. Moves each fully processed file from `RAW_DATA_DIR` to `INGESTED_DATA_DIR`.

**Required environment variables:**

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `WAREHOUSE_DATABASE_URL` | SQLAlchemy MySQL URL for the warehouse DB |
| `RAW_DATA_DIR` | Directory containing raw JSON files (default: `./data/raw`) |
| `INGESTED_DATA_DIR` | Archive directory for processed files (default: `./data/ingested`) |

**Run:**

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy pymysql python-dateutil
python n8n/scripts/youscan_normalize_mentions.py
```
