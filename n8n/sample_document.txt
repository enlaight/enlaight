1. INTRODUCTION TO ENLAIGHT
================================================================================

Enlaight is a comprehensive platform for managing AI-powered knowledge bases 
and intelligent agents. It provides a unified interface for creating, 
organizing, and querying knowledge bases, as well as deploying and managing 
AI agents that can interact with this knowledge to provide intelligent responses.

Key Features:
  • Knowledge base management and organization
  • AI agent configuration and deployment
  • Project-based access control
  • Chat session tracking and history
  • Multi-user collaboration


================================================================================
2. GETTING STARTED WITH KNOWLEDGE BASES
================================================================================

Knowledge Bases (KBs) are collections of documents, files, and information 
that AI agents can query to provide accurate and contextual responses. Each 
knowledge base can contain multiple file types including PDFs, documents, 
and structured data.

Creating a Knowledge Base:
  1. Navigate to the Knowledge Bases section
  2. Click 'Create New Knowledge Base'
  3. Enter a name and description
  4. Select the project to associate with
  5. Add files and documents to your KB

KB Features:
  • Multiple file format support
  • Full-text search capabilities
  • Version control and history
  • Access control per project
  • Real-time indexing


================================================================================
3. MANAGING PROJECTS
================================================================================

Projects are the top-level organizational unit in Enlaight. Each project can 
have multiple knowledge bases, agents, and team members. Projects help 
organize different business domains or clients.

Project Features:
  • Assign multiple users to a project
  • Link multiple knowledge bases
  • Configure agents
  • Track conversations

Project Setup:
  1. Create a new project with a descriptive name
  2. Associate with a client
  3. Add team members
  4. Configure linked knowledge bases
  5. Set up agents


================================================================================
4. AI AGENTS AND EXPERTISE AREAS
================================================================================

AI Agents are intelligent bots trained to handle specific tasks or expertise 
areas. You can create multiple agents within a project, each with different 
capabilities and expertise areas.

Types of Expertise Areas:
  • General Support - Handles common queries
  • Technical Documentation - Provides technical assistance
  • Customer Service - Manages customer interactions
  • Data Analysis - Analyzes and interprets data
  • Sales Consulting - Assists with sales processes

Agent Configuration:
  1. Define agent name and description
  2. Select expertise area
  3. Configure knowledge base links
  4. Set response parameters
  5. Deploy agent


================================================================================
5. CHAT SESSIONS AND INTERACTIONS
================================================================================

Chat Sessions allow users to interact with AI agents and knowledge bases. 
Each session maintains conversation history and context, enabling more 
intelligent and personalized interactions.

Session Features:
  • Real-time conversations with AI agents
  • Access to relevant knowledge base documents
  • Context-aware responses
  • Session history and transcripts
  • User feedback and ratings

Starting a Chat Session:
  1. Select an agent
  2. Choose relevant knowledge base
  3. Begin conversation
  4. Agent references KB documents
  5. Review and save session transcript


================================================================================
6. BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

Organize Knowledge Bases:
  Create separate KBs for different topics or departments to improve search 
  accuracy and relevance. Use clear folder structures and naming conventions.

Regular Updates:
  Keep your knowledge bases up-to-date with the latest information and 
  documentation. Review and archive outdated content regularly.

Clear Naming:
  Use descriptive names for projects, KBs, and agents to make them easily 
  identifiable. Include relevant keywords for better searchability.

User Permissions:
  Manage user access carefully to ensure data security and proper access 
  control. Implement role-based access control where applicable.

Monitor Performance:
  Regularly review chat sessions and agent responses to optimize performance. 
  Gather user feedback to improve agent accuracy.

Document Structure:
  Organize documents with clear headings and sections. Use consistent 
  formatting for better indexing and retrieval.

Quality Control:
  Validate document content for accuracy and completeness. Remove duplicates 
  and consolidate related information.
